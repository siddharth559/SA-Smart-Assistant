# SA-Smart-Assistant
SA (abbreviation of smart assistant) is a free and open source cross platform virtual assistant. It is built to run on Windows Linux and mac(yet to be tested). SA can open software, do Google and Wikipedia searches, search find word meanings and several other functionaries. It also has speech recognition facilities making it almost fingerless interface.

Standalone portable applications are available only for windows and linux 64bit systems:
windows : https://github.com/siddharth559/SA-Smart-Assistant/releases/download/v1.0.1/sa.zip
linux : https://github.com/siddharth559/SA-Smart-Assistant/releases/download/v1.0.1/sa_linux.zip
alternatively you can download the source code at: https://github.com/siddharth559/SA-Smart-Assistant/releases/tag/v1.0.1 

After downloading extract the zip files, inside them you will find sa.exe(win)/sa(linux); click on it. Linux peeps might have to open in terminal and type./sa to launch

By just speaking **"listen"** you can bring the windows upwards, alternatively this can be achieved by clicking on the **red cross button**(this can also take the window down).In linux the same thing will fade the window in/out, after this you will see "listening" in one of the Labels.

And thats it,. you opened SA. Now you may try writing **open chrome** in the entry box, and next you may see the chrome window. In a similar way you can open any software.

Now I would suggest you to type **where is (some place)**, while typing you may observe some autocompletes, after pressing enter SA will show you some wikipedia extracts for the your search entry. You can also do this by speaking. 

Similarly you can also search **meaning of (some word)** to find its meaning from wiktionary.

**search (some thing)** to see the google search extracts

The mic button starts the speech interface. Alternatively this can also be achieved by simply speaking listen while window is opened.
